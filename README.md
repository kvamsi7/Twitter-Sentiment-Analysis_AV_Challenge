# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis_AV_Challenge

### The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

### I quite like this task because hate speech, trolling and social media bullying have become serious issues these days and a system that is able to detect such texts would surely be of great use in making the internet and social media a better and bully-free place
